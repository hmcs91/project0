            <h2 class="article">Recently readed: Moby Dick</h2>
            <p class="article">The book that I've readed most recently was Moby Dick. This is a classic of English literature. As indicated in the book, it was several years after the author's death that readers showed interest in it. The book tells the story if a man who decided to join a whaler ship to capture whales and their fat, very useful in that period of time. However, there was a huge whale that had fought for her life and accidents had ocurred when trying to capture her, among then, the captain of that ship lost his leg. This man had a single purpose: to find and kill Moby Dick, the name granted to the whale. The book explain what happened. If you are eager to know the end, go for the book. No more than 4-6-8 hours will take you to finish it.</p>

            <h2 class="article">Recently played: Dark</h2>
            <p class="article">The serie that I've seen most recently was Dark season 2 produced by Netflix. This is a serie about time travels. It's a squeeze story that gives its own explanation of life. It's reduced to pre-programed actions and events that trigger what it's supposed to happen next. This left you without choise. No free will. In season one, they introduce this concept and let you know that life is a timeline in cycles of 33 years. Just at the end of the second season they introduced a new element: dimensions. Now, it happens that not only you move in circles in time but also you are jumping from one dimension to another where a different story has been written. The question is: Will they really be able to change the future or the past or the present? God knows what is next in season 3. Definetly not a happy ending. Punctuation: 7/10.</p>

            <h2 class="article">Recently listened to: Speak Life</h2>
            <p class="article">This is a song intepreted by Toby Mac. Its main message is to make us think about what it would happen if the words that we speak were full of love, hope and life. The results would be incredible differents to what we're used to. Anger could be turned into postive energy, hate could be turned into love, miserableness could be turned into hope. Odds are that you will feel all this sentiments and try to react to them in the same way, however it's up to you to spoil your day for a hatchet job on you.</p>

            <h2 class="article">Recently learned: Français</h2>
            <p class="article">There is no doubt that languages are so interesting. Each one possess specific structures, phonetics, and particular ways to see life. All that make learning a language exciting. Now there are pleny of options to learn the system of communication used by a particular community in a country. Duoling was my choice to learn French. Now I have more than 90 days developing the skills needed to, at least, ask for a coffee in Paris! haha <a class="article" href="https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=fr&tl=en&text=Excuse%20moi%20mademoiselle%2C%20je%20voudrais%20boir%20un%20café%2C%20s'il%20te%20plaît!">(Excuse moi madmeoiselle/garçon, je voudrais boir un café, s'il te plaît!)</a></p>
